Are You Quicker Than A Quick Response?
=============================
Browser-based game using a QR reading smartphone as an external "controller."

Modeled on first-person shooting video games, the player must only aim the QR reader at the multicolored QRs to advance to the next level, while avoiding the advertisement codes in black that swarm the browser window.

Good luck.
