Are You Quicker Than A Quick Response?
=============================
Browser-based game using a QR reading smartphone as an external "controller."

Modeled on first-person shooting video games, the player must try to only scan at the black QRs to advance to the next level, while avoiding the multicolored advertisement codes that swarm the browser window.

Good luck.
